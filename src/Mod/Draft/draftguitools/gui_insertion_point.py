"""Provides insertion-point cycling for interactive object placement commands.

During interactive placement, a command may offer several candidate anchor
points on the object's cross-section (for instance, its center, corners, and
edge midpoints) rather than always anchoring at the center. This module
provides the shared, object-agnostic mechanics for that: the candidate table,
the anchor offset calculation, the keyboard cycling behavior, and the
associated status bar hint. A consuming command supplies its own cross-section
dimensions, placement rotation, and (optionally) a shape origin offset; this
module has no knowledge of what kind of object is being placed.

    Computes one of nine candidate points on the cross-section (center + 4 corners +
    4 midpoints), selected by *insertion_index*, then transforms it to world space using
    *rotation*. Subtract the result from the cursor point to place the object with the
    chosen insertion point aligned to the cursor.

    *rotation* must be the same value the caller uses to set the object's actual
    placement, so the anchor can never end up somewhere other than where the object
    actually lands.

    ----------
    cross_section_width, cross_section_height : float
        The object's cross-section dimensions.
    insertion_index : int
        Index into the 9-point candidate table (wraps around).
    rotation : FreeCAD.Rotation
        The object's actual placement rotation.
    width_axis, height_axis : FreeCAD.Vector, optional
        The local axes the width and height candidates run along. Default to
        local X and Y. Pass different axes when the object's cross-section
        lies in a different local plane, such as local Y and Z for an object
        extruded along local X.
    cross_section_center : FreeCAD.Vector, optional
        The local point the unshifted (center) candidate sits at. Defaults to
        the local origin (0, 0, 0). Pass a non-zero value when the candidates
        apply to a face other than the one through the local origin, such as
        a column's base face at (0, 0, -Height/2).
    shape_origin : FreeCAD.Vector, optional
        The shape's geometric origin in local coordinates, relative to
        *cross_section_center*. Defaults to no shift. Pass a non-zero value
        for shapes whose geometry is not built from the center, such as one
        built from a corner.
