            This method injects Coin3D nodes into the 'FlatRoot' container to map a texture onto the
            covering, with one texture image per tile.

            Implementation details:
              - Target node: The method targets the 'FlatRoot' SoSeparator, which is reused by
                FreeCAD to render face geometry in both "Flat Lines" and "Shaded" display modes.
              - Rendering contexts: The rendering context for 'FlatRoot' differs between display
                modes, requiring separate logic:
                - "Flat Lines": Renders as part of a composite view alongside other nodes (e.g.,
                  NormalRoot). This context requires texture coordinates to be transformed into the
                  object's Local Space.
                - "Shaded": Renders 'FlatRoot' in isolation. This context requires texture
                  coordinates to be in Global Space.
              - Material Override: For "Shaded" mode, the texture's blend model is set to REPLACE to
                override the mode's default SoMaterial, which would otherwise wash out the texture.

            Texture mapping:
              - A SoTextureCoordinatePlane node defines the texture projection.
              - The mapping period is (TileLength + JointWidth) to ensure the texture repeats in
                sync with the tile grid, preventing drift.
              - A SoTexture2Transform node aligns the texture's origin with the calculated grid
                origin to respect the TileAlignment property.

            Parameters
            ----------
            obj : App::FeaturePython
                The Covering object containing dimensional, alignment, and placement data.
            display_mode : str
                The current display mode ("Flat Lines", "Shaded", etc.), which determines whether
                coordinates are resolved in local or global space.

            Returns
            -------
            tuple or None
                A tuple containing (dir_u, dir_v, s_offset, t_offset) where dir_* are normalized
                FreeCAD.Vectors and *_offset are floats representing the normalized texture
                coordinate shift. Returns None if the geometry basis cannot be resolved.

            Notes
            -----
            Texture mapping is performed via linear projection using a period equal to (Tile +
            Joint). Because standard Coin3D mapping nodes cannot skip the empty space of the joint,
            the mapping is shifted backwards by half the joint width. This workaround centers the
            image on the physical tile body, ensuring that any loss of texture due to the joint is
            distributed symmetrically across the edges.

            .. todo::
               The coordinate basis resolution and alignment shift logic replicates the code in
               `ArchCovering.execute`. This should be refactored into a shared helper method to
               ensure consistence and reduce maintenance overhead.

    class ArchCoveringTaskPanel:
        """
        A Task Panel for creating and editing Arch Covering objects.

        This class manages user input and property states using a session-based buffer (the
        template) to ensure transactional stability and atomic undos.

        Parameters
        ----------
        command : object, optional
            The FreeCAD command instance that invoked this panel.
        obj : App.DocumentObject, optional
            The existing Covering object to edit. If None, the panel operates in creation mode.
        selection : list, optional
            A list of pre-selected objects or sub-elements to apply the covering to.

        Notes
        -----
        This class employs a "Buffered Proxy" pattern. Instead of binding UI widgets directly to the
        final architectural objects, it binds exclusively to an internal, hidden _CoveringTemplate
        (the template). This ensures:

        *   Batch creation: A single set of UI settings can be applied to multiple faces.
        *   Undo stability: Internal UI state changes do not pollute the document's undo history.
        *   Atomic continue: Each object created in "Continue" mode is a separate undoable event.

        Data flow and binding:

        1.  **Initialization:** the UI widgets bind exclusively to the template buffer. If in
            Edit Mode, the template is initialized once with the values of the real object.
        2.  **Synchronization:** when the user interacts with the UI, the _sync_ui_to_target()
            method updates the properties of the template buffer.
        3.  **Transfer (the flush):** When accept() is called:
            *   A new, short-lived document transaction is opened.
            *   In Creation: New objects are instantiated and settings are stamped from the
                template master using template.apply_to(new_obj).
            *   In Edition: The existing object is updated using template.apply_to(obj_to_edit).
            *   The transaction is committed immediately.
        4.  **Cleanup:** The template is destroyed only when the panel is closed, ensuring
            it never appears in the document history or Tree View.

            Notes
            -----
            1. Transaction management is manual here. This method opens a transaction explicitly.
               Any early `return` statement added within the `try` block must ensure the transaction
               is committed or aborted first, otherwise it will block the undo stack.
            2. This method is connected to a Qt signal. Uncaught exceptions are frequently
               suppressed by the Python/Qt bridge. We use `traceback.print_exc()` to ensure the full
               stack trace appears in FreeCAD's Report View for notification purposes.
